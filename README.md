Readme file for project4 - Brevet Time Calculator Webpage

Calculates control point open/close times for brevets of various distance

Author = Kevin Roeske
github = https://github.com/kevinroeske/proj4-brevets.git


Notes:

Everything seems to work exactly as the official calculator, except that invalid (too long, negative, etc) values return a generic
value rather than throwing an error

Known bugs:

I wanted the page to clear all previous entries when the brevet distance is changed, but I couldn't get it to work
