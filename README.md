Readme file for project4 - Brevet Time Calculator Webpage

Author = Kevin Roeske
github = https://github.com/kevinroeske/proj4-brevets.git


Notes:

This works... mostly. The calculator seems to work perfectly fine for everything except 1000km brevets, but it breaks
down there. Should work accurately for distances up to 10% over the brevet total distance.

To use my test suite: go to the /brevets directory and type ./nosetests
The tests only check the 200km times, using expected values extracted from the calculator on the provided web site
If late assignments are accepted, I will submit a more complete version sometime over the weekend
